/**
 * 
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
