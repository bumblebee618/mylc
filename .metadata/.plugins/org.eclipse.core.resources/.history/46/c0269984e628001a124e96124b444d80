Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:
	You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
	Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

Example 1:
	Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
	Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:
	Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
	Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
	Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
	Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

	 * Actually, the problem is the same as "Given a collection of intervals, 
	 * find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling). 
	 * With the solution to that problem, guess how do we get the minimum number of intervals to remove? : )
	 * Sorting Interval.end in ascending order is O(nlogn), 
	 * then traverse intervals array to get the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals is O(n). Total is O(nlogn).
